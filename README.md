# Level 35 - "Room Coordinates"
Following along with the C# Player's Guide by RB Whitaker
## Topic
Structs
## Criteria:
1. Create Coordinate struct that represents a room coordinate row and column
2. Ensure that the Coordinate struct is immutable
3. Create a method that determines if a coordinate is adjacent to another coordinate (if the row or number column is +/- 1 to the one next to it)
4. The main method should create at least several coordinates the implement the adjacency check method
